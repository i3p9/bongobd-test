# Bongobd-test

Repo for Bongo SQA Code Test

## Running

Install pip package requirements
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
And finally run the test by running `main.py`

> Note: There are some usage of `time.sleep()` because the network that the script was tested on was slow and thus took time to load some content compared to when browsing the website with a good internet connection.
